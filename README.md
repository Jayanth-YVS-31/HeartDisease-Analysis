# HeartDisease-Analysis

In this work i applied CART model to predict the heart disease analysis, then i reworked on the dataset and applied K means clustering to detect outiers,then an ANN model is built to classify the records.

I always wanted to do something to make it more enjoyable for the viewers and i tried that in this work.

Always ready for suggestions to improve.
